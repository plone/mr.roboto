Repository: ${repo}
Author: ${who}
Plone Version: ${pv}

This package is used by Plone coredev ${pv} branch,
but itâ€™s not currently checked out so is not including
your change for testing.

If you were merging a pull request,
worry not mr.roboto took care of it already,
still double check checkouts.cfg:

https://github.com/plone/buildout.coredev/blob/${pv}/checkouts.cfg

On the other hand, if you made a direct commit to a branch,
add the package to checkouts.cfg (above link) please.

Regards,
mr.roboto
